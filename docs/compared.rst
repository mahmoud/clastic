* Simple, Python-based API designed to minimize learning curve
* Minimum global state, designed for concurrency
* Respectable performance `in microbenchmarks <https://github.com/the-benchmarker/web-frameworks>` (`not that it matters <https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/benching-microbenchmarks-c2aa2655c5b>`_)
* Rich dependency semantics guarantee that endpoints, URLs, middlewares, and resources line up before the Application will build to start up.
